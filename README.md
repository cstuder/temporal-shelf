[![PHPUnit tests](https://github.com/cstuder/temporal-shelf/workflows/PHPUnit%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cstuder/temporal-shelf/actions?query=workflow%3A%22PHPUnit+tests%22)

PHP package to shelve files in directory structures according to years/months/days.

Created for usage on [api.existenz.ch](https://api.existenz.ch) and indirectly on [Aare.guru](https://aare.guru). As of 2020 in productive use.

## Installation

`composer require cstuder/temporal-shelf`

## Example usage

```php
<?php
require('vendor/autoload.php');

$shelf = new \cstuder\TemporalShelf\TemporalShelf($targetDirectory);

$shelvedFilename = $shelf->shelveFile($filename);
```

See `docs/example.php` for a full working example.

## Documentation

The `temporal-shelf` library copies files into a shelf (a file archive). A shelf is a directory structure with the default path containing current year, month and day. Additionally the file gets a prefix containing the current timestamp.

I.e.: The file `download.txt` is shelved to `/archive/2020/10/21/1603308783_download.txt`.

The directory structure is generated automatically, with permissions `0755` set.

Both path (`$directoryPattern`) and prefix (`$prefixPattern`) can be configured with a string which is then passed through the PHP [DateTime::format](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php) method.

Example: Setting `$directoryPattern = "Y/W"` and `$prefixPattern = "N_"` would shelve the file to `/archive/2020/43/3_download.txt` (Generating a weekly directory per year).

Files are silently overwritten if the generated filename already exists.

Exceptions are thrown when the file is not readable, when the directory structure cannot be built or if the copying fails.

Files are copied. The original file is left untouched and has to be cleaned up by yourself.

### \_\_construct(string $shelfDirectory, string $directoryPattern = 'Y/m/d', string \$filePrefixPattern = 'U\_', string \$timezone = 'UTC')

Creates the TemporalShelf object and sets the configuration.

`$shelfDirectory` is the target archive directory root.

`$directoryPattern` is the pattern of the subdirectories where the files are to be sorted in.

`$filePrefixPattern` is the prefix added to the filename when shelving. Set it to `''` in order to disable the prefixing.

`$timezone` is a timezone identifier used when converting the timestamp of the file to the directory path.

Does not validate the shelf directory.

### shelveFile($filename, int $timestamp = null): string

Shelves a file with the current configuration and an optional timestamp. If the timestamp is null, takes the current time.

Returns the full path to the shelved file.
